## Limitations
Here are some known bugs:
* Unsubmitted reviews will appear in the reviews menu for all markers

## Features for Future
What we'd like to build in the future:
* Reports can auto delete when reaching a set number of dislikes
*   When a user dislikes a report it can also remove itself from only their map
* Users can submit multiple images per report
* Users can navigate using the app and navigation will automatically
*   avoid streets with reported incidents
